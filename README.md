# About the Project
When should I make a reddit post so that I can maximize upvotes and comments?

This project aims to solve this question by taking a dive into reddit post data for r/funny, one of the largest subreddits. Our report is located under [FinalProject.ipynb](https://github.com/cs1212/COGS108_Reddit-Data-Analysis/blob/master/FinalProject.ipynb)

# About the Dataset
Our data comes from r/funny and we wrote a [script](https://github.com/cs1212/COGS108_Reddit-Data-Analysis/blob/master/Reddit%20Scraping.ipynb) to automatically collect data on all posts made over the course of 24hrs. We collected data for all 7 days.
